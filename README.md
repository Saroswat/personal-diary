# personal-diary
personal diary management system in C
In this console application, you can add, view, edit and delete records. Records can be added with many information such as duration of task, name, address, time and date. File handling has been effectively used to keep the records.

The basic user-defined functions used in this project are listed below:

int password() – contains/manages/handles password protection
void addrecord() – to add new diary record
void viewrecord() – to view added record in list
void editrecord() – to modify and update an added record
void editpassword() – to modify/change a password
void deleterecord() – to delete or remove a record permanently from system file
In this project, you need to enter a password to view, edit or delete record. Password is not required to view the main menu or to add record. We have used password in other mini projects in Code with C; what’s little different in this project is that you can edit the password within the application i.e., after executing or upon running the project.

Your password is currently ‘Enter’ for this mini project. Don’t type e-n-t-e-r. Press the Enter key!
